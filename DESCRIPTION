Description: The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) is a hand-specific 
    outcomes instrument which measures the health outcomes of patients with 
    chronic hand conditions. The MHQ contains six distinct scales (1) overall 
    hand function, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) pain, (4) work 
    performance, (5) aesthetics, and (6) patient satisfaction with hand 
    function. There is also a demographic section asking questions about 
    patientsâ€™ gender, ethnic background, etc.
